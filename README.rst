Test harness for Docker container images

Seaworthy has similar goals to `TestContainers`_, although it is written in
Python and is based on our experience with testing Docker images.

Project status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Seaworthy is in the early stages of development and will be undergoing lots of
change. The project was split out of the tests we wrote for our
`docker-django-bootstrap`_ project. There are examples of Seaworthy in use
there.
